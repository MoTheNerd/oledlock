# OLEDLock | a Dots Tweak
### What does OLEDLock do?
> So, OLEDLock is still a work in progress and it's first release is yet to be published however eventually, it build on the "Dots" tweak on Cydia created by [**@shyam_lad**](https://twitter.com/shyam_lad) and
> [**@DavidJGoldman**](https://twitter.com/DavidJGoldman). It should introduce the ability to have an always on display regardless of if you have new notifications or not and will allow you to add widgets to the lockscreen like animated backgrounds, custom widgets, and more info for notifications.

### When will you release it?
> Hard to say. University is taking up most of my time. I'd like to finish this as fast as possible because it's super fun to work on this but courses are a necessity too sooo...
### What are some of the current issues you're having?
> Well right now I can't seem to get the Dots tweak to load up every single time I want (i.e. whenever I press the power button). We'll see how this goes because perhaps the Developers of Dots will manually add that capability (which
> makes lives so much easier for most other developers).
### What can we expect in the future?
> Further Development on this tweak! I'm hoping to release it by sometime in June but it's going to be a long and hard journey remembering I'm still pretty new at this stuff.
### What if I wanna work on this?
> You have two options,
> 1. Fork this repository and start working it on your own time
> 2. Email me at mohammad@enggmomo.me if you wanna do a colab :fire:
